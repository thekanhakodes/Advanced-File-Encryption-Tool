# 🔐 Advanced File Encryption Tool

A user-friendly, GUI-based file encryption and decryption tool that uses AES-256 encryption with password-derived keys to securely protect your files.

---

## 📝 Project Description

This Python-based application provides a secure way to encrypt and decrypt files using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a 256-bit key. It features a simple graphical interface built with `tkinter`, making it easy for non-technical users to handle file encryption tasks. Ideal for personal use, small businesses, or anyone looking to protect sensitive data without needing command-line skills.

## ⚙️ Features

* 🔒 AES-256 encryption using password-derived keys (PBKDF2 + SHA-256)
* 🧂 Secure random salt and IV generation for every encryption
* 🗂️ File selection via GUI dialog (no command-line required)
* 🧑‍💻 Simple, beginner-friendly interface
* ✅ Error handling and user feedback through message boxes
* 🛡️ Encrypted files are saved with `.enc` extension; decrypted files use `.dec`

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

* Python 3
* `tkinter` for GUI
* `cryptography` library for AES encryption (CBC mode with PKCS7-like padding)
* `secrets`, `base64`, and `os` for secure key and file handling
